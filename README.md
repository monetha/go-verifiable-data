## Development

### Build

Install dependencies:

```bash
make dependencies
```

Make sure that the tests and the linters pass:

```bash
make lint
make test
```

To get the test coverage report for all packages, run the command:

```bash
make cover
```

Ð¢est coverage results (`cover.out`, `cover.html`) will be put in `./.cover` directory.

1. Copy all artifacts to [`contracts/code`](contracts/code) folder.
1. Run `go generate` command in [`contracts`](contracts) folder to convert Ethereum contracts into Go package.
1. Commit new/updated files.
